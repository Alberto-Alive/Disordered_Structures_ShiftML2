# Overview

Use this scripts pack to predict chemical shifts in disordered structures through [ShiftML2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c03854). The project was funded by [STFC (CCP-NC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) and developed by [Popescu Alberto](https://github.com/Alberto-Alive) under [Shenton Kane's](https://github.com/jkshenton) guidance. You can find the repository at [Disordered Structures ShiftML2](https://github.com/Alberto-Alive/Disordered_Structures_ShiftML2). Free to use under the [MIT](https://github.com/Alberto-Alive/Disordered_Structures_ShiftML2/blob/origins/MIT-LICENCE.txt) licence.
